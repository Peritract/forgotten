<h1>Hello once more, World!</h1>
<p>This page does more than it used to, and that's worth celebrating.</p>
<p>Loads of complex stuff is happening behind the scenes.</p>
<p>If you come back later, it will have improved even more, if you can imagine such a thing.</p>
<p>The text is in red for testing css reasons, not aesthetic ones. Control blob with arrow keys.</p>
