#### A retro-styled 2D platformer game built in Phaser 3

![](forgotten_screenshot.png)

#### Preamble

This is a short platformer game that I made for two main reasons:

1. To work out how to use Phaser 3

2. To understand what Webpack is

I find that I am much more *au fait* with both technologies now. 

#### Dependencies

Phaser 3

#### Installation

#### Playing

#### Adding levels
